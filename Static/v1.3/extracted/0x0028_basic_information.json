This attribute MAY be used by clients to optimize communication with Nodes by allowing them to use more than the strict minimum values required by this specification, wherever available. The values supported by the server in reality MAY be larger than the values provided in this attribute, such as if a server is not resource-constrained at all. However, clients SHOULD only rely on the amounts provided in this attribute. Note that since the fixed values within this attribute MAY change over time, both increasing and decreasing, as software versions change for a given Node, clients SHOULD take care not to assume forever unchanging values and SHOULD NOT cache this value permanently at Commissioning time."

The version number can be compared using a total ordering to determine if a version is logically newer than another one. A larger value of SpecificationVersion is newer than a lower value. Nodes MAY query this field to determine the currently supported version of the specification on another given Node. The format of this number is segmented as its four component bytes. Bit positions for the fields are as follows: Bits 31..24: Major version of specification, Bits 23..16: Minor version of specification, Bits 15..8: Patch version of the specification, Bits 7..0: Reserved1 (Future reserved version field 1, set to 0 until defined). For example, a SpecificationVersion value of 0x0102AA00 is composed of 4 version components, representing a version 1.2.170.0. The initial revision (1.0) of this specification (1.0) was 0x01000000. Matter Spring 2024 release (1.3) was 0x01030000. If the SpecificationVersion is absent or zero, such as in Basic Information cluster revisions prior to Revision 3, the specification version cannot be properly inferred unless other heuristics are employed. Comparison of SpecificationVersion SHALL always include the total value over 32 bits, without masking reserved parts."
