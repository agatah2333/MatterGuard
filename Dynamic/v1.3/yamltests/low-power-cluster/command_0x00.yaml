- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: No attribute change; the device remains in its current state.
  ExpectedResponse: FAILURE (if the device is already in low power mode or cannot
    enter low power mode due to some constraints)
  Pre-requisites: 'The device must support the Low Power Cluster and be in a state
    where it cannot enter low power mode (e.g., already in low power mode or some
    other operational constraint).


    These test cases cover the scenarios of sending the `Sleep` command under normal
    conditions and under conditions where the device cannot enter low power mode.
    The expected responses and attribute changes are based on the command''s description
    and typical device behavior.
