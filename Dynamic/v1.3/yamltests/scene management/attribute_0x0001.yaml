  Attribute_Change: SceneTableSize should be set to the maximum supported by the device,
    which is less than or equal to 253 entries per fabric.
  ExpectedResponse: The maximum value for a uint16 is 65535, but the SceneTableSize
    should be constrained by the device's capabilities and the specification's maximum
    of 253 entries per fabric.
  Pre-requisites: 'The device should support the Scene Management cluster and have
    the capability to handle the maximum number of scenes.


    These test cases ensure that the `SceneTableSize` attribute is tested for both
    its minimum and maximum constraints, as well as for any special handling as per
    the specification【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:10†source】.'
