  Attribute_Change: The attributes related to the scene (e.g., `TransitionTime`, `SceneName`,

    0 and `SceneID` 0.

    These test cases cover the extreme values of the constraints of the fields and
    the values that could result in special responses as mentioned in the description
    of the effect.
