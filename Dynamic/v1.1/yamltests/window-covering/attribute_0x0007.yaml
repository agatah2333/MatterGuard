  attribute: '0x0007'

name: window-covering_attribute_0x0007_v1.1.0.0
tests:
- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: '`ConfigStatus` will be set to 0x00.'
  ExpectedResponse: The window covering should be non-operational, with normal lift
    and tilt movements, and no position-aware or encoder control.
  Pre-requisites: The window covering device should be installed and powered on.
  arguments:
    Control - Lift: 0
    Control - Tilt: 0
    Encoder - Lift: 0
    Encoder - Tilt: 0
    Operational: 0

- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: '`ConfigStatus` will be set to 0x3D.'
  ExpectedResponse: The window covering should be operational, with reversed lift
    movements, position-aware control for both lift and tilt, and encoder control
    for both lift and tilt.
  Pre-requisites: 'The window covering device should support all the features being
    tested (reversal, position-aware control, and encoder control).


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the constraints of the `ConfigStatus`
    attribute and the values that could result in special responses as described in
    the specification【4:0†source】【4:1†source】【4:6†source】.'
