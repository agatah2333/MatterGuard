  ExpectedResponse: The transition should happen instantly.
  Pre-requisites: The device must support variable transition times.

- ActionTime: 65535
  Attribute_Change: '`CurrentLevel` will change to the target level over 6553.5 seconds.'
  ExpectedResponse: The transition should take the maximum possible time (6553.5 seconds).
  Pre-requisites: 'The device must support long transition times.


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `OnOffTransitionTime` attribute
    and ensure that the device handles both instant and maximum duration transitions
    correctly.
