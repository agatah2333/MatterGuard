- ActionTime: <current_time>
  Attribute_Change: '- `PumpStatus`: Bit 6 (MotorTemperatureHigh) set to 1'
  ExpectedResponse: Motor temperature is high but not critical.
  Pre-requisites: '- Pump must be running.


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the temperature field and a special
    response scenario where the temperature is high but not at the maximum limit.
    The expected responses and attribute changes are based on the description of the
    event and its effect on the pump''s status【4:1†source】【4:2†source】.'
