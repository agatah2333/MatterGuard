tests:
- ActionTime: <current_time>

  ExpectedResponse: Event generated successfully
  Pre-requisites: Node must complete a boot or reboot process
  arguments:

- ActionTime: <current_time>
  Attribute_Change: None
  ExpectedResponse: Event generated successfully
  Pre-requisites: 'Node must complete a boot or reboot process


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `SoftwareVersion` field and ensure
    that the event is generated correctly under these conditions. The `ActionTime`
    should be set to the current time when the event is generated. The expected response
    is that the event is generated successfully, and no attributes are changed as
    a result of this event. The pre-requisite for both test cases is that the node
    must complete a boot or reboot process before generating the StartUp event.
