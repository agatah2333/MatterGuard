- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: '`OnOff` attribute will be set to `FALSE`'
  ExpectedResponse: SUCCESS
  Pre-requisites: '`OnOff` attribute is initially `TRUE`


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the constraints of the field (since
    there are no data fields, the constraints are related to the `OnOff` attribute''s
    state) and the values of the field that could result in special responses (toggling
    the `OnOff` attribute and updating `OnTime` and `OffWaitTime` attributes accordingly).
