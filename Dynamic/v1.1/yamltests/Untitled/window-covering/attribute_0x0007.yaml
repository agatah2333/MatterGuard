  ExpectedResponse: The window covering should be operational, with reversed lift
    movements, position-aware control for both lift and tilt, and encoder control
    for both lift and tilt.
  Pre-requisites: 'The window covering device should support all the features being
    tested (reversal, position-aware control, and encoder control).


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the constraints of the `ConfigStatus`
    attribute and the values that could result in special responses as described in
