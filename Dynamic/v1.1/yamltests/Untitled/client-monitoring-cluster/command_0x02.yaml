    These test cases cover the extreme values of the constraints of the field (since
    there are no data fields, the constraints are related to the `OnOff` attribute''s
    state) and the values of the field that could result in special responses (toggling
    the `OnOff` attribute and updating `OnTime` and `OffWaitTime` attributes accordingly).
