    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `SoftwareVersion` field and ensure
    that the event is generated correctly under these conditions. The `ActionTime`
    should be set to the current time when the event is generated. The expected response
    is that the event is generated successfully, and no attributes are changed as
    a result of this event. The pre-requisite for both test cases is that the node
    must complete a boot or reboot process before generating the StartUp event.
