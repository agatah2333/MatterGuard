  ExpectedResponse: The door lock server requires that an optional PIN be included
    in the payload of remote lock operation events like Lock, Unlock, Unlock with
    Timeout, and Toggle in order to function.
  Pre-requisites: The door lock server must support the `RequirePINForRemoteOperation`
    attribute.

    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `RequirePINForRemoteOperation`
    attribute, which is a boolean field, and the values that could result in special
    responses as mentioned in the description of the effect.
