    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `Reachable` attribute (True and
    False) and the scenarios where the reachability status changes, which could result
    in special responses as mentioned in the description of the effect【4:3†source】【4:14†source】.'
  arguments:
    '{"Reachable"': False}
  option: WriteAttribute
