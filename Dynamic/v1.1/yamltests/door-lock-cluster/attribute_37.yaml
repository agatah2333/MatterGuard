name: door-lock-cluster_attribute_37_v1.1.0.0
tests:
- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: '`RequirePINForRemoteOperation` will be set to True.'
  ExpectedResponse: The door lock server requires that an optional PIN be included
    in the payload of remote lock operation events like Lock, Unlock, Unlock with
    Timeout, and Toggle in order to function.
  Pre-requisites: The door lock server must support the `RequirePINForRemoteOperation`
    attribute.

- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: '`RequirePINForRemoteOperation` will be set to False.'
  ExpectedResponse: The door lock server does not require that an optional PIN be
    included in the payload of remote lock operation events like Lock, Unlock, Unlock
    with Timeout, and Toggle in order to function.
  Pre-requisites: 'The door lock server must support the `RequirePINForRemoteOperation`
    attribute.


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `RequirePINForRemoteOperation`
    attribute, which is a boolean field, and the values that could result in special
