  Pre-requisites: 'Thermostat should be in a state where all relays are active, including
    unimplemented ones treated as Off.


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `ThermostatRunningState` attribute
    and ensure that the system handles both all relays being off and all relays being
    on, including unimplemented ones.
