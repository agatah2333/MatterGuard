- ActionTime: <current_time>
  Attribute_Change: '- `CurrentPosition`: `NumberOfPositions` - 1'
  ExpectedResponse: Event generated successfully
  Pre-requisites: '- `NumberOfPositions` should be greater than 1


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `NewPosition` field and ensure
    that the event is generated correctly when the switch is moved to the first and
    last positions.
