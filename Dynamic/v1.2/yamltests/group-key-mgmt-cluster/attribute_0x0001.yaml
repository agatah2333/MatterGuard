    - The GroupTable attribute is read-only and reflects data managed via the Groups
    cluster.

    - The GroupTable SHALL NOT contain any entry whose GroupInfoMapStruct has an empty
    Endpoints list.

    - If a RemoveGroup or RemoveAllGroups command causes the removal of a group mapping
    from its last mapped endpoint, the entire GroupTable entry for that given GroupId
    SHALL be removed【4:0†source】【4:6†source】.
