  Attribute_Change: '- No attribute change as the command will not be executed.'
  ExpectedResponse: NotActive
  Pre-requisites: '- Media endpoint must not be active for playback.


    These test cases cover the scenarios where the `Stop` command is issued under
    normal conditions and when the media endpoint is not active, which should result
    in a special response.
