name: media-playback-cluster_command_0x04_v1.2.0.0
tests:
- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: CurrentState attribute will be set to reflect the state after
    the "Previous" command is executed.
  ExpectedResponse: Success
  Pre-requisites: The media playback should be in a state where the "Previous" command
    is valid (e.g., not at the first item in the playlist).
  arguments: {}
  label: Test_Case_Extreme_Values_of_Constraints
  option: SendCommand
- ActionTime: N/A
  Attribute_Change: No attribute will be changed as the command is not allowed.
  ExpectedResponse: NotAllowed
  Pre-requisites: 'The media playback should be in a state where the "Previous" command
    is not allowed (e.g., at the first item in the playlist).


    These test cases cover the scenarios where the command is executed under normal
    conditions and where it is expected to return a special response due to constraints
    in the playback state.
