tests:
- ActionTime: Any time after a reboot
  Attribute_Change: None, as the OverrunCount is already 0.
  ExpectedResponse: The OverrunCount should be 0.
  Pre-requisites: The Node must have been recently rebooted.

- ActionTime: After a period of high network traffic
  Attribute_Change: None, as this is a read-only diagnostic attribute.
  ExpectedResponse: The OverrunCount should be at its maximum value, indicating a
    severe buffer memory issue.
  Pre-requisites: 'The Node must have experienced a high volume of network traffic
    leading to buffer memory exhaustion.


    These test cases cover the extreme values and special conditions for the `OverrunCount`
    attribute in the Thread Network Diagnostics Cluster.'
