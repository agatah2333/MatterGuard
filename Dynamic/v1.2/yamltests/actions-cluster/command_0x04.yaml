  Attribute_Change: '- No attribute will be changed as the action ID is invalid.'
  ExpectedResponse: Error (e.g., `InvalidActionID`)
  Pre-requisites: '- The action with `ActionID` 0xFFFF does not exist.


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the `ActionID` field and a special
    response scenario where an invalid `ActionID` is provided.
