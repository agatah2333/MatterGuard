    These test cases cover the extreme values and special responses for the `Off`
    command in the On/Off cluster. The expected behavior is derived from the specification
    that states the `OnOff` attribute should be set to `FALSE` and the `OnTime` attribute
    should be set to `0` upon receiving the `Off` command【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.'
  arguments:
    OffWaitTime: 0
    OnOff: 'FALSE'
