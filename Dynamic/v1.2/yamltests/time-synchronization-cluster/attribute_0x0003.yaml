  ExpectedResponse: SUCCESS
  Pre-requisites: The node is synchronized to an upstream source using a high-resolution
    time-synchronization protocol such as NTP, or has built-in GNSS with some amount
    of jitter applying its GNSS timestamp. UTC Time is accurate to ± 50ms.

    time-synchronization protocol such as PTP, or has built-in GNSS. UTC time is accurate
    to ± 10 μs.


    These test cases cover the extreme values of the constraints of the field and
